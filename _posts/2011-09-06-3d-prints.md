I&#8217;ve been printing a lot of things since I finally resolved some motor problems. Check them out!

I dealt with a lot of motor issues and finally got a stormtrooper head printed after several attempts.

This octopus was my first raftless print, meaning that it came out of the makerbot just like it looks here!

Yes, the whistle actually works! The ball is printed attached and knocked loose with a screwdriver or knife.

I used a kinect to take a 3D picture of my niece and nephew.
