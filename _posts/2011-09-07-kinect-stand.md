I&#8217;m going to the <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/artandcode.com/3d/');"  href="http://artandcode.com/3d/">Art &#038;&#038; Code 3D</a> kinect hacking conference at CMU, and I figured it would be nice to have a way to mount my kinect right to my laptop. So far I&#8217;ve only downloaded and printed 3D models made by others (thanks to <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/thingiverse.com');"  href="http://thingiverse.com">thingiverse</a>) and have been <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/jherrm/6074487043/');"  href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jherrm/6074487043/">really frustrated</a> by the usual 3D modelers out there. I finally tried out <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.openscad.org');"  href="http://www.openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a>, which takes a programmatic approach to 3D modeling and it makes loads more sense to me than anything else I&#8217;ve used.

<a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flickr.com/photos/jherrm/6122778920/');"  href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jherrm/6122778920/" title="Kinect Stand in OpenSCAD by jherrm, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6194/6122778920_8a074b2aca.jpg" width="500" height="390" alt="Kinect Stand in OpenSCAD" /></a>

After a few false starts because of the kinect base being nearly the same size as the build platform, I was able to get a print in under an hour and a half.

I was really happy to see my measurements were spot on and the design fit the kinect really well.

The only problem is the kinect is heavy enough to pull down the monitor if the screen is leaned back too far.

At some point, I came to realize how crazy this all is &#8211; I wanted something that didn&#8217;t exist, designed it, and printed it out. We live in the future, and it is amazing.
