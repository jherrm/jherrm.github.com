Storage cabinets are great for organizing small parts. Unfortunately the one I recently bought from Lowes didn&#8217;t come with drawer dividers. (I should have read the <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.lowes.com/pd_124553-941-DSB-39_');"  href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_124553-941-DSB-39_">reviews</a> first.)

I started to make my own from an old CD case but realized that they cracked easily and looked like crap.

Then I remembered I had a 3D printer, and smacked myself for even trying to cut them myself. I fired up OpenSCAD and before too long had a model of a divider custom fit to the drawers in my cabinet.

It took my Makerbot Cupcake a few minutes to print the first version and it fit really well.

The script is fully parameterized so you can customize it to fit whatever drawers are out there.
