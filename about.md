Hi, I'm Jeremy.
I enjoy making things with whatever tools I can get my hands on.
I'm a founder of [Plethora][plethora], a rapid manufacturing service
and [chogger][chogger], a website that lets you create comics.
I've been known to fly drones, bowl, play trombone and wield a telescope from time to time.
